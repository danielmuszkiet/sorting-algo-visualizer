# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

This project is a sorting algorithm visualizer that allows users to observe the execution of three fundamental sorting algorithms:

- Bubble Sort
- Insertion Sort and
- Selection Sort.

The visualizer provides an intuitive graphical representation of how each algorithm rearranges elements to sort a given array.

## Features

1. Visualization of Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, and Selection Sort algorithms.
2. User-friendly interface for easy interaction.
3. Input array customization for experimenting with various datasets.
